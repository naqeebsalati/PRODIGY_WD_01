Landing Page with Interactive Navigation Menu

I created a landing page with an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when the page is scrolled or when hovering over a menu item. The navigation menu has a fixed position and is visible on all pages, ensuring a consistent user experience. The project is implemented using HTML for structuring the menu, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding interactivity.


Features
Fixed Position: The navigation menu remains fixed at the top of the page, providing easy access to all menu items regardless of scrolling.
Scroll Effect: The menu changes its background color or font color when the user scrolls down the page.
Hover Effect: When hovering over a menu item, its style changes to enhance the interactive experience.
Technologies Used
HTML: To structure the navigation menu.
CSS: To style the menu and add hover and scroll effects.
JavaScript: To implement the dynamic behavior when scrolling or hovering.


Future Improvements
Adding more pages with smooth scrolling effects.
Implementing responsive design for better viewing on mobile devices.
Adding animations for a more engaging experience.
Feel free to fork, modify, and suggest improvements to this project!
